# Android2Nix

*As you may see this repo is work in progress*

This tool was build upon [status-react](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/tree/develop/nix) approach of building Android apps with Nix.

## Steps (for now)

### Set Nix up 

For setting Nix up it is recommended to use provided template. To initialize template, please run `flake init -t "github:Mazurel/android2nix"`. You can also go through it manually and see how to use it.

### After setting Nix up

Load up dev shell and generate deps.json

```
nix develop .
# To get all options avaiable via generate, run generate --help
generate --root-dir <Android app dir>
```

Build the app
```
nix build .#release
```

If they are some missing dependencies, add them manually to the `additional-deps.list` and rerun `generate` command (`gen_deps_list`, `gen_deps_urls` and `gen_deps_json` tasks).
It should go faster the second time as there is some basic caching implemented.

## Known issues

- Sometimes `generate` may file on generating urls due to timeout, you will need to rerun it again.
- Sometimes dependencies are loaded correctly. In this case you need to add them manually to the `additional-deps.list`, see chapter below.
- Gradle witness breaks when you are using local repo (can be fixed)

## Possible fixes for issues

### Gradle can't resolve XYZ dependency

If you are facing this kind of issue, you will need to manually update `additional-deps.list` file (packages are newline separated).
Just add `<dependency and version>` to this file, got into devshell and run:

```bash
generate --task gen_deps_list ...(rest of args)
generate --task gen_deps_urls ...(rest of args)
generate --task gen_deps_json ...(rest of args)
```

This should resolve such issue.

## Gradle witness support

Currently witness is not (yet!) supported. You will need to disable it for your project when building with Nix.
